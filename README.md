# Face_Verification_Project
AI-based Face Verification with Liveness &amp; Anti-Spoof Detection – A real-time system that verifies a person’s face from their resume or passport photo while ensuring authenticity through blink, head-movement, and anti-spoof detection (to prevent printed or replayed faces).


# 🧠 Face Verification with Liveness & Anti-Spoof Detection

An AI-powered real-time **Face Verification System** that validates a person’s face from their **resume or passport photo**, ensuring authenticity through **blink detection**, **head movement**, and **anti-spoofing** (to prevent printed or replayed faces).

---

## 🚀 Features
- 📄 Extracts and compares faces from **PDF resumes** or **ID/Passport photos**
- 🧠 Uses **DeepFace**, **OpenCV**, and **face_recognition** for feature encoding
- 🧍‍♂️ Detects **real vs spoofed faces** using ONNX liveness models
- 🧾 Automatically logs verification results with timestamps
- 🧩 Modular codebase for easy updates and experimentation
